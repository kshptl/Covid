# Covid-19 Quarantine Emission Impact Model

1. Created a chart to visualize the impact on emissions from reduced mobility due to Covid-19 quarantine in USA.
2. Cleaned and joined Google mobility data with Air Quality Index data at the county-level using Pandas in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Utilized Spark to distribute data processing on Amazon EMR cluster to import data from S3 and perform data analysis.

The mobility data was acquired from [Google's mobility report](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/).
