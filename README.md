# Covid-19 Quarantine Emission Impact Model

1. Created a chart to visualize the impact on emissions from reduced mobility due to Covid-19 quarantine in USA.
2. Cleaned and joined Google mobility data with Air Quality Index data at the county-level using Pandas in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Utilized Spark to distribute data processing on Amazon EMR cluster to import data from S3 and perform data analysis.


### Data Sources
